# Salary_prediction

This project is an NBA players' salary prediction app built using Python. The app predicts the salaries of NBA players based on their statistics and other relevant features.
## Features

- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Includes implementations of Random Forest, Linear Regression, and other models to provide accurate salary predictions.
- **Interactive UI**: The app is built using Streamlit, allowing users to interactively input player features and view predictions in real time.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizes the relationships between features and predicted salaries using various charts and plots.
- **Model Evaluation**: Includes evaluation metrics such as R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), etc., to measure the performance of the models.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive user interface.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For data analysis, preprocessing, and model development.
- **Python**: Programming language used for building and deploying the machine learning models.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
